## I'm Alona.

Here I'll tell you dozens of things that I have somewhere in my notes/gists/docs. It's time to sweep the dust from all that stuff and share it with the world.

I am a *Software Engineer* with more than seven years of experience. Right now, I am a **Team/Tech Leader**. My team is what I *love* the most in my everyday work. I am passionate about mentoring and coaching others, helping them to grow and develop their skills and knowledge.
I thrive in a fast-paced and dynamic environment and am committed to delivering high-quality results that exceed expectations.

My major stack is TS/JS and React. Three of my favorite topics are *web vitals, accessibility, and unit/functional testing*. In my spare time, I'm coding using Go and Kotlin because why not.

What is more? I have a bachelor's degree with honors in Computer Science and Information Technologies, and I want to get a Master, but still looking for an opportunity that will thrive me. And you'll learn more about this journey in the future.

As for my personal life, I have two cats, my Ukrainian passport, and a strong belief in our victory.
