Yesterday, I had a discussion with my friend on this topic, and I think I have something to share with you.
I'm not just an **Engineering Manager**, I'm much, much more. Let me share some insights from our conversation:

## How does my work affect my biggest hobby?

From the top of my mind, I can say that **logical thinking** and my love for **math** help me understand numbers and some complicated things behind construction. I can easily calculate how to replace the yarn and how much I need.

**Programming taught me** that if I'm not sure about a solution, I should just start, and it will work out. You know what? **Knitting patterns** can scare me when reading them for the first time, but I'm not afraid to start anymore.

And my favorite skills: **time management** and **prioritization**. Believe me, this is **important** if you want to juggle work, hobby, personal life, a YouTube channel, and an Instagram blog.

## How does my hobby affect my work?

First and most importantly, **knitting showed me that any mistake can be fixed, and IT'S OKAY TO START OVER!**

Let's not forget that **making something with your hands helps to decrease stress** and switch off your brain after a whole day of work.

And as a nice perk, I became **more creative**, which helps me see work tasks from a different perspective. I can think about unobvious but interesting solutions.

How's your work-life balance? Maybe you also feel that **life outside of work** affects our careers, and it's important to maintain a **life-work balance**.
